My name is Damien Dormal and I am a software developer based in Perth, Western Australia. The languages I master are Javascript (and node), Ruby, Java, but I like to explore and I am fluent in Scala, Haskell, C ...

I worked in many different industries, such as telecom, eduction and public sector. More recently, I am trying to get a bit more involve with the open source community through helping projects on [github](https://github.com/).
