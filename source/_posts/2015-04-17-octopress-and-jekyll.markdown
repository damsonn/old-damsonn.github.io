### Jekyll

I have been thinking about starting a blog for a little while now.
I heard about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a couple of years ago, it seemed like a good fit so I tried it.
It is a very simple static site generator, which process markdown files.

### Octopress

Then I started looking at [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), mainly because of the collection of themes.
But it also provides some good features on top of *Jekyll*, such as a plugin mechanism.
Overall I don't really need anything from it, on top of that I actually preferred the simplicity of Jekyll.
The main dev of Octopress is currently working on [Octopress 3](http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/).
It should create a much more modular foundation and hopefully become cleaner ecosystem.

### Github pages

Something to note is that [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses *Jekyll*, so you have a free hosting option.
On top of being free you have the best backup system / history you can ask -> GIT

### what's next
I basically have two options, either I use Octopress 3 when it become stable or I move my blog to vanilla Jekyll.
